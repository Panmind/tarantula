Tarantula: A big fuzzy spider
=============================
Crawls your Rails application, fuzzing data to see what breaks.

Example Usage:
==============

Create a Rails integration test that looks like this, filling in your
own auth params of course:

    def test_with_login
      post '/sessions/create', :password => 'your-pass'
      assert_response :redirect
      assert_redirected_to '/'
      follow_redirect!
      tarantula_crawl(self)
    end

If you want to set custom options, you can get access to the crawler and set
properties before running it. For example, this would turn on HTMLTidy.

    def test_with_login
      post '/sessions/create', :password => 'your-pass'
      assert_response :redirect
      assert_redirected_to '/'
      follow_redirect!
      t = tarantula_crawler(self)
      t.handlers << Relevance::Tarantula::TidyHandler.new
    end

If you run the test you will get a report in tmp/tarantula. You can also
set VERBOSE=true to see more detail as the test runs.

For more options see the test suite.
