Tarantula: A big fuzzy spider
=============================
Crawls your Rails application, fuzzing data to see what breaks.

Example Usage:
==============

Create a Rails integration test that looks like this, filling in your
own auth params of course:

    def test_with_login
      get '/sessions/new'
      assert_response :success
      post '/sessions/create', :password => 'your-pass'
      assert_response :redirect
      assert_redirected_to '/'
      follow_redirect!
      Relevance::Tarantula::Crawler.rails_integration_test(self)
    end

If you run the test you will get a report in tmp/tarantula. You can also
set VERBOSE=true to see more detail as the test runs.

For more options see the test suite.
